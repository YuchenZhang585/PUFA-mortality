Higher ratio of plasma omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids is associated with greater risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality: a population-based cohort study in UK Biobank

## Background
Circulating omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various chronic diseases and mortality, but results are conflicting. Few studies examined the role of omega-6/omega-3 ratio in mortality. 

## Methods
We investigated plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs and their ratio in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank. Of 85,425 participants who had complete information on circulating PUFAs, 6,461 died during follow-up, including 2,794 from cancer and 1,668 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Associations were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for relevant risk factors.

## Data
The UK Biobank study is a prospective, population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom. Between 2006 and 2010, 502,384 prospective participants, aged 40-69, in 22 assessment Centers throughout the UK were recruited for the study. The population information was collected through a self-completed touch-screen questionnaire; brief computer-assistant interview; physical and functional measures; and blood, urine, and saliva collection during the assessment visit.

The datasets analyzed during the current study are available from the UK Biobank through an application process (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
